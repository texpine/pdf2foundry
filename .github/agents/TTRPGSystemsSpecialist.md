# System Specialist Agent

2. Map generic attributes to system fields:
   - Actor: HP, AC, abilities, skills, saves
   - Item: damage, properties, rarity
   - Scene: grid settings, lighting defaults
3. Convert stat blocks to system format
4. Validate data against system requirements
5. Handle missing data with sensible defaults
